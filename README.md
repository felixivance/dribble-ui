## Improvements or Recommendations or Feedback

- could have have used better tools to get actual images from dribble or unsplash if using a real project
- could have used better fonts to match the actual dribble UI with access to the tooling platform example Figma
- could have used better animations to match the actual dribble UI with access to the tooling platform example Figma
- could have used exact metrics and dimensions to match the actual dribble UI with access to the tooling platform example Figma
- could have used better tests to test the components, and perform e2e tests with cypress or puppeteer to test the whole application
